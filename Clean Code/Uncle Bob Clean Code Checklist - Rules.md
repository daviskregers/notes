-   **We will not ship shit**
    -   You know it works before release
    -   The code is the highest quality proportional to the time has been allocated to it
-   **We will always be ready**
    -   System is ready to deploy at the end of sprint
    -   Code, testing, documentation has been done
    -   It is shippable
-   **Stable productivity**
    -   You do now slow down as the project grows longer. Usually we are getting slower as we make mess in the code.
-   **Inexpensive adaptability**
    -   Cost of change should be proportional to scope. Changing text for a button shouldn't take 6 months.
    -   There should be a good suite of tests
-   **Continuous Improvement**
    -   Code should improve with time not degrade.
    -   With time it should use design patterns / architectures.
-   **Fearless competence**
    -   Clean code, do not let the code rot.
    -   Do not be afraid to touch the code.
    -   Tests + refactoring
    -   Check it in a bit better than you found it.
-   **We will not dump on QA**
    -   Not the group that finds bugs.
    -   QA should be at the start of the process, not the end.
    -   Expect for QA to find nothing
-   **All tests should be automated**
-   **We will cover for each other.**
    -   You should be able to step in for someone else.
    -   Someone else should be able to cover for you.
    -   Pairing might come in handy.
-   **Give honest estimates**
    -   Define a shape of what we don't know
    -   PERT estimation technique
    -   I expect you will say no when the answer is no
    -   I expect you are going to be able to deal with pressure.
