## Reused Abstraction Principle (RAP)

- RAP states that there should be at least three implementers on an [[interface]] or a [[base class]] ([[rule of three]])
- [[Abstraction]] eliminates irrelevant and amplifies the essential

- Start with a concrete implementation of a specific behavior
- Observe the emerging commonalities
- Apply the rule of three
