## What is design?

- Design of software is [[source code]] itself
- [[Architecture]] is the shape which code takes

- The [[source code]] specifies how software works
- Final product is a running program

## Building Software

- Big design upfront is very expensive in [[software development]]
- No guarantee that we take into account all the possible [[requirements]]
- Requirements tent to change very quickly
- Keep the design as clean as you can

There can be multiple [[Design smells]], you can deal with them using [[SOLID Principles]].
