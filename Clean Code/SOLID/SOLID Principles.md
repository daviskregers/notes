Solid principles are principles on how we should deal with [[Software Design]].
There can be different [[Design smells]] and it lists how to deal with them.

## SOLID Principles

- SRP - [[Single Responsibility Principle]]
- OCP - [[Open-Closed Principle]]
- LSP - [[Liskov Substitution Principle]]
- ISP - [[Interface Segregation Principle]]
- DIP - [[Dependency Inversion Principle]]

These principles are not bound to any [[technology]], you can apply them to any language.
SOLID is not a goal, it can't really be measured .


## Metaprinciples
