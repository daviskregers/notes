## Architecture

- Any software system has an [[architecture]]
- There's no "the highest level of abstraction of a system"
- Architecture has a social role (communicative)
- [[DBMS]] and [[UI]] are just tools, strive to make them irrelevant.

## Design

- Software design is about designing the individual modules or components
- What are the responsibilities, functions of module x? or class y?
- What can it do? what not?

## Architecture and Design Patterns

- [[Architecture patterns]] are standard forms of relationships between components that are deemed to be significant.
    - [[2 tier architecture]]
    - [[3 tier architecutre]]
    - [[Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)]]
    - [[Event-Driven Architecture]]
    - [[cloud architecture]]
- They can be split into - [[behavioral design patterns]], [[structural design patterns]] and [[creational design patterns]].
