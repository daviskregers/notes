# Conclusion

- When applying [[Single Responsibility Principle]] we want to separate different [[concern]]s
    - A [[class]] should do one thing and do it well!
- We can apply [[Single Responsibility Principle]] at different levels: [[Function level]], [[Object level]], [[Module level]]
- Classes with many responsibilities are hard to understand
- When [[Single Responsibility Principle]] is violated, responsibilities start to [[collate]] with each other
- Don't abuse [[Single Responsibility Principle]]
- Apply the [[Facade design pattern]] to simplify the [[API]]
- [[Module]]s that change frequently should be isolated from the other parts of system
