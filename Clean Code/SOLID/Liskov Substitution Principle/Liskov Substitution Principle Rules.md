The [[Liskov Substitution Principle]] states that Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

- Do not violate a [[Contract]] by either [[strenghtening precondition]]s or [[weakening postcondition]]s;
- Do not violate [[Covariance]]/[[Contravariance]], explicitly mark the [[generic parameters]] by [[in-out keywords]] if possible.
