-   **3 rules of TDD**

    1.  You are not allowed to write any production code before you have written a test that ==fails because the production code doesn't exist==.

    2. You are not allowed to write more of a test that is sufficient ==to fail. Not compiling is also failing. As soon as the test does not compile, you must stop writing it and fix it==.

    3. You are not allowed to write any more ==production code that is== sufficient to ==pass the failing test==.
