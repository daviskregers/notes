![[Rule of Three]]


## When adding a feature

- [[Refactoring]] helps you to understand code. If you have to deal with someone else's code, [[refactor]] it first. Clean code is easier to understand, will improve for yourself and others.
- Makes it easier to add new features and make changes.

## When fixing a bug

- Bugs in code behave just like those in real life. [[Clean code]] and the [[error]]s will show up.
- Managers appreciate proactive refactoring as it eliminates the need for special refactoring tasks later.

## During a code review

- The [[code review]] may be the last chance to tidy up before it becomes available for the public.
