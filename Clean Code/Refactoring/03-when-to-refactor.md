# When to refactor

## Rule of Three

1. When you're doing something for the first time, just get it done.
2. When you're doing something similar for the second time, cringe at having to repeat but do the same thing anyway.
3. When you're doing something for the third time, start refactoring.

## When adding a feature

- Refactoring helps you to understand code. If you have to deal with someone else's code, refactor it first. Clean code is easier to understand, will improve for yourself and others.
- Makes it easier to add new features and make changes.

## When fixing a bug

- Bugs in code behave just like those in real life. Clean code and the errors will show up.
- Managers appreciate proactive refactoring as it eliminates the need for special refactoring tasks later.

## During a code review

- The code review may be the last chance to tidy up before it becomes available for the public.
