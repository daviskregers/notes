-   **Comments**
    -   Most of the time comments are code smell
        -   They tend to compensate for bad code
        -   They deteriorate over time and can lie
        -   Most of the time are useless
    -   There really should be following comments:
        -   Legal / copyright comments
        -   Comments when you cannot use a more descriptive name due to a design pattern
        -   Hard to understand lines like regex query
    -   When writing comments
        -   Should reveal intent
        -   Are applied to local scope only
-   **Naming names**
    -   Should reveal intent
    -   Variable name length should be proportional to the scope that contains it.
    -   Function and class name length should be inverse proportional to the scope. The larger scope - the shorter it should be, more abstract.
    -   Avoid using names with "data", "info".

> Color comments red - read them - if useless, delete them.>

Why are comments considered a code smell?
?
- They tend to compensate for bad code
- They deteriorate over time and can lie
- Most of the time are useless
<!--SR:!2022-11-04,3,250-->

These are the comments that should be allowed:
?
- Legal / Copyright comments
- Comments when you cannot use a more descriptive name due to a design pattern
- Hard to understand lines like regex query
<!--SR:!2022-11-04,3,250-->

When writing comments you should:
?
- Reveal intent
- Apply them to the local scope only
<!--SR:!2022-11-04,3,250-->

Variable names should reveal ==intent==.
<!--SR:!2022-11-05,4,272-->

Variable name length should be ==proportional to the scope that contains it==.
<!--SR:!2022-11-05,4,272-->

Function and class name length should be ==inverse proportional to the scope. The larger scope - the shorter it should be, more abstract==.
<!--SR:!2022-11-05,4,272-->

Avoid using names with::"data", "info"
