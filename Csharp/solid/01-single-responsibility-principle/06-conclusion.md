# Conclusion

- When applying SRP we want to separate different concerns
    - A class should do one thing and do it well!
- We can apply SRP at different levels: function, object, module
- Classes with many responsibilities are hard to understand
- When SRP is violated, responsibilities start to collate with each other
- Don't abuse SRP
- Apply the Facade pattern to simplify the API
- Modules that change frequently should be isolated from the other parts of system
