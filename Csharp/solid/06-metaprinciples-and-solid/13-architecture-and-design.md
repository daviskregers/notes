# Architecture and design

## Architecture

- Any software system has an architecture
- There's no "the highest level of abstraction of a system"
- Architecture has a social role (communicative)
- DBMS and UI are just tools, strive to make them irrelevant.

## Design

- Software design is about designing the individual modules or components
- What are the responsibilities, functions of module x? or class y?
- What can it do? what not?

## Architecture and Design Patterns

- Architecture patterns are standard forms of relationships between components that are deemed to be significant.
    - 2-tier
    - 3-tier
    - SOA
    - Event-Driven
    - Cloud
- They can be split into - behavioral, structural and creational patterns.
