# Removing the funciton

We need to clean up following things:
- Function
- Dependencies of the function
- CloudWatch Log Groups
- IAM Roles
- Everything else the framework has created

Thankfully, the serverless solves this problem for us.

```console
âžœ  hello-world-python git:(master) sls remove
Serverless: Getting all objects in S3 bucket...
Serverless: Removing objects in S3 bucket...
Serverless: Removing Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack delete progress...
.....
Serverless: Stack delete finished...

Serverless: Stack delete finished...
```
