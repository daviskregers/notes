# Hybrid Cloud for Storage

- AWS is pushing for "hybrid cloud"
    - Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
    - Part of your infrastructure is on-premise
- This can be due to
    - Long cloud migrations
    - Security requirements
    - Compliance requirements
    - IT strategy
- S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on premise? AWS Storage Gateway.

## AWS Storage Gateway

- Bridge between on-premise data and cloud data in S3
- Use cases: disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage
- 3 types of Storage Gateway
    - File Gateway
        - Configured S3 buckets are accessible using the NFS and SMB protocol
        - Supports S3 standard, S3 IA, S3 One Zone IA
        - Bucket access using IAM roles for each File Gateway
        - Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway
        - Can be mounted on many servers
    - Volume Gateway
        - Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3
        - Backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premise volumes
        - Cached volumes: low latency access to most recent data
        - Stored volumes: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3
    - Tape Gateway
        - Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes
        - With Tape Gateway, companies use the same process but in the cloud
        - Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier
        - Back up data using existing tape-based processes (and iSCSI interface)
        - Works with leading backup software vendors

- File access / NFS => File Gateway (backed by S3)
- Volumes / Block Storage / iSCSI => Volume gateway (backed by S3 with EBS snapshots)
- VTL Tape solution / Backup with iSCSI => Tape Gateway (backed by S3 and Glacier)
