# EC2 Instance Launch Types

- On Demand Instances
    - Pay for what you use (billing per second, after the first minute)
    - Has higher cost but no upfront payment
    - No long term commitment
    - Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave.
- Reserved instances
    - Up to 75% discount compared to On-demand
    - Pay upfront for what you use with long term commitment
    - Reservation period can be 1 or 3 years
    - Reserve a specific instance type
    - Recommended for steady state usage applications (like databases)
- Covertible Reserved Instances 
    - can change the EC2 instance type
    - Up to 54% discount
- Scheduled Reserved Instances 
    - launch within time window you reserve
- Spot instances - short workloads, for cheap, can lose instances
    - Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
    - You bid a price and get the instance as long as it's price is under the price
    - Price varies on offer and demand
    - Spot instances are reclaimed with a 2 minute notification warning when the spot price goes above your bid
    - Used for batch jobs, Big Data analysis, or workloads that are resilient to failures.
    - Not great for critical jobs or databases.
- Dedicated instances
    - Instances running on hardware that's dedicated to you
    - May share hardware with other instances in same account
    - No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)
- Dedicated Hosts 
    - Physical dedicated EC2 server for your use
    - Full controll of EC2 instance placement
    - Visibility into the underlying sockets / physical cores of the hardware
    - Allocated for you account for a 3 year period reservation
    - More expensive
    - Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL - Bring Your Own License)
    - Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

## Hands on

When viewing EC2 instances on the left sidebar, we have a list of these types available.

Then, we can search for a reserved instance with a term of 12 months and payment upfront.

Similar process goes for all the other types.

For spot instances, we can click on launch an instance and in the configuration, set settings for it.

Same goes with dedicated hardware, we can select that in the same form.

## Deep Dive

- R - applications that need a lot of RAM - in-memory caches
- C - applications that needs good CPU - compute / databases
- M - applications that are balanced - general / web app
- I - applications that needs good local I/O - storage
- G - applications that need a GPU - video rendering / machine learning
- T2 / T3 - burstable instaces 
    - AWS has the concept of burstable instances
    - Burst means that overall, the instance has OK CPU performance
    - When the machine needs to process something unexpected (a spike in load for example), it can burst, and CPU can be VERY good.
    - If the machine bursts, it utilizes "burst credits"
    - If all the credits are gone, the CPU becomes bad
    - If the machine stops bursting, credits are accumulated over time
    - Amazin to handle unexpected traffic and getting the instance that it will handle it correctly
    - If your instance consistently runs low on credit, you need to move to a different kind of non-burstable instance
    
- T2 / T3 - unlimited
    - It is possible to have an unlimited burst credit balance
    - You pay extra money if you go over your credit balance, but you don't lose performance
    - Overall, it is a new offering, so be careful, costs could go high if you're not monitoring the health of your instances
