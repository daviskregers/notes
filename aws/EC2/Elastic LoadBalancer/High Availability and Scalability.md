# High Availability and Scalability

- Scalability means that application / system can handle greater loads by adapting.
- There are two kinds of scalability:
    - Vertical scalability
    - Horizontal scalability
- Scalability is linked but different to High Availability


## Vertical Scalability

- Vertical scalability means increasing the size of the instance
- For example, your application runs on a t2.micro
- Scaling that application vertically means running it on a t2.large
- Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as databases.
- RDS, ElastiCache are services that can scale vertically.
- There's usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale (hardware limit)

## Horizontal Scalability

- Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of instances / systems for your application
- Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems
- This is very common for web applications / modern applications
- It's easy to horizontally scale thanks to the cloud offerings such as EC2

# High Availability

- High Availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
- High availability means running your application / system in at least 2 data centers (Availability Zones)
- The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss
- The high availability can be passive (for RDS Multi AZ for example)
- The high availability can be active (for horizontal scaling)
