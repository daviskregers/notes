# AWS Lambda

## Why AWS Lamda

- EC2
    - Virtual Servers in the Cloud
    - Limited by RAM and CPU
    - Continuously running
    - Scaling means intervention to add / remove servers
- Lamda
    - Virtual functions - no servers to manage
    - Limited by time - short executions
    - Run on-demand
    - Scaling is automated

## Benefits of AWS Lamda

    - Free tier of 1,000,000 AWS Lamda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time
- Integrated with the whole AWS Stack
- Integrated with many programming languages
- Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
- Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 3GB of RAM)
- Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network

## Language support

- Node.js
- Python
- Java
- C# / .NET Core
- Golang
- C# / Powershell

## Integrations

## Lamda@Edge

- You have deployed a CDN using CloudFront
- What if you wanted to run a global AWS Lamda alongside?
- Or how to implement request filtering before reaching your application?
- For this, you can use Lamda@Edge
    - Deploy lamda functions alongside your CloudFront CDN
        - Build more responsive applications
        - You don't manage servers, Lamda is deployed globally
        - Customize the CDN content
        - Pay only for what you use
- You can use Lamda to change CloudFront requests and responses
    - After CloudFront receives a request from a viewer (viewer request)
    - Before CloudFront forwards the request to the origin (origin request)
    - After CloudFront receives the response from the origin (origin response)
    - Before CloudFront forwards the response to the viewer (viewer response)
    - You can also generate responses to viewers without ever sending the request to the origin.
