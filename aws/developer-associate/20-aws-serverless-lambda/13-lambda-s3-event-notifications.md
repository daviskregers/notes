# Lambda & S3 Event Notifications

- S3:ObjectCreated, S3:ObjectRemoved, S3:ObjectRestore, S3:Replication...
- Object name filtering possible (*.jpg)
- Use case: generate thumbnails of images uploaded to S3
- S3 event notifications typically deliver events in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer
- If two writes are made to a single non-versioned object at the same time, it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent
- If you want to ensure that an event notification is sent for every successful write, you can enable versioning on your bucket.
