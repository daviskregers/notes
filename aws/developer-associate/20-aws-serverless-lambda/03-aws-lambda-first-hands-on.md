# AWS Lambda - First Hands On

On the begin screen of the AWS Lambda we can play around with it and run functions.

We can also have lambdas respond to events.

We are going to click on the Create function button. There we can choose between multiple options for our function. We are going to use a Bluprint of `hello-world-python`.

Then we are going to configure the blueprint. Give it a name and create basic permissions.

The code will remain unchanged and we will create the function. Once it's created, we will see a code editor available to change our function.

We can also test it, but first we need to configure a test event.

And we can now test the function.

We can also configure various settings like, memory, timeouts, execution role.

We can also monitor the lambda for how many times it was invoked, for how long, errors vs successes etc.

We can also see logs of the invocations.
