# Amazon EKS Overview

- Amazon EKS - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
- It is  a way to launch managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS
- Kubernetes is an open-source system for automatic deployment, scaling and management of containerized (usually Docker) applications.
- It's an alternative to ECS, similar goal but different API
- EKS supports EC2 if you want to deploy worker nodes or Fargate to deploy serverless containers
- Use case: if your company already is using Kubernetes on-premises or in another cloud, and wants to migrate to AWS using Kubernetes
- Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic (can be used in any cloud - Azure, GCP...)
