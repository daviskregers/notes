# S3 Pre-signed URLs

- Can generate pre-signed URLs using SDK or CLI
    - For downloads (seasy, can use the CLI)
    - For uploads (harder, must use the SDK)
- Valid for a default of 3600 seconds, can change timeout with --expires-in argument
- Users given a pre-signed URL inherit the permissions of the person who generated the URL for GET / PUT

Examples:
- Allow only logged-in users to download a premium video on your S3 bucket
- Allow an ever changing list of users to download files by gnerating URLs dynamically
- Allow temporarily a user to upload a file to a precise location in our bucket
