# IAM Security Tools

We can use the IAM Security Tools for following actions:

- IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
    - A report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.
- IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
    - Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
    - Can be used to enforce the principle of least privilege - revise the policies for each user.
