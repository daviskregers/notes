# Determining how long to run an experiment

## How do I know when I'm done with an A/B test?

- You have achieved significance (positive or negative)
- You no longer observe meaningful trends in your p-value
    - That is, you don't see any indication that your experiment will "converge" on a result over time
- You reach some pre-established upper bound on time
