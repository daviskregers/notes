# Ethics of Deep Learning

## Types of errors

- Accuracy doesn't tell the whole story
- Type 1: False positive
    - Unnecessary surgery
    - Slam on the brakes for no reason
- Type 2: False negative
    - Untreated conditions
    - You crash into the car in front of you

- Think about the ramifications of different types of errors from your model, tune it accordingly.

## Hidden biases

- Just because your model isn't human doesn't mean it's inherently fair
- Example: train a model on what sort of job applicants get hired, use it to screen resumes.
    - Past biases toward gender / age / race will  be reflected in your model, because it was reflected in the data your trained the model with.

## Is it really better than a human?

- Don't oversell the capabilities of an algorithm in your excitement
- Example: medical diagnostics that are almost, but not quite, as good as a human doctor
- Another example: self-driving cars that can kill people


## Unintended applications of your research

- Think of how can this be twisted and be used in a different way.
