# Introducting Keras

## Why keras?

- Easy and fast prototyping
    - Available as a higher-level API in tensorflow 1.9+
    - scikit_learn integration
    - Less to think about - which often yields better results without even trying
    - The faster you can experiment, the better your results are.
