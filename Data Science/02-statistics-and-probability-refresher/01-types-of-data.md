# Types of data

## Major types of data

- Numerical
    - Represents some sort of quantitative measurement like page load times, stock prices etc.
    - Discrete data - integer based, often counts of some event.
    - Continuous data
        - How much time did it take for a user to check out?
- Categorical
    - Qualitative data that has no inherent mathematical meaning
        - Gender, Yes/no, race, state of residence, product category etc
    - You can assign numbers to categories in order to represent them more compactly, but the numbers don't have mathematical meaning.
- Ordinal
    - A mixture of numerical and categorical
    - Categorical data that has a mathematical meaning
    - Example: movie ratings on 1-5 scale.
        - Ratings must be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5
        - But these values have mathematical meaning - 1 means it's a worse movie than 2.
