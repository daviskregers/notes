## Probability density function

Speak to a probability of a given range of values happening.

The probability distribution function gives you the probability of a data point falling within some given range of a given value.

- (-σ; 0) = 34.1%
- (0; σ) = 34.1%
- (-2σ; -σ) = 13.6%
- (1σ; 2σ) = 13.6%
- etc...

## Probability mass function

When dealing with discrete data, we use probability mass function.
It basically is a histogram that shows how many times each event has happened.
