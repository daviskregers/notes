# Data cleaning and normalization

Python notebook: https://github.com/daviskregers/data-science-recap/blob/main/24-cleaning-data.ipynb

- The reality is, much of your time as a data scientist will be spent preparing and cleaning your data.
    - Outliers
    - Missing data
    - Malicious data
    - Erroneous data
    - Irrelevant data
    - Inconsistent data
    - Formatting

## Garbage in, garbage out

- Look at your data, examine it.
- Question your results.
    - And always do this - not just when you don't get a result that you like.
