Rust is a [[system level]] [[programming language]]. 

## Why Rust?

### Performance

Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no [[runtime]] or [[garbage collector]], it can power [[performance-critical service]]s, run on [[embedded devices]], and easily integrate with other languages.

### Reliability

Rust’s rich [[type system]] and [[ownership model]] guarantee [[memory-safety]] and [[thread-safety]] — and enable you to eliminate many classes of bugs at [[compile-time]].

### Productivity

Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated [[package manager]] and [[build tool]], smart [[multi-editor support]] with auto-completion and [[type inspection]]s, an auto-formatter, and more.

Basically, Rust is new age [[C++]] that has built with [[security]] in mind when using access to the [[memory]].
