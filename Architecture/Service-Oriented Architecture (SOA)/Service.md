A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently. 

A service has 4 properties according to [[Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)]]:
1. It logically represents a repeatable business activity with a specified outcome.
2. It is self-contained.
3. It is a [[block box]] for consumers, meaning the consumer does not have to be aware of the service's inner workings.
4. It may be composed of other services.
