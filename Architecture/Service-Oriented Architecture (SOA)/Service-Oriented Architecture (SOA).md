Architectural style that focuses on discrete [[Service]]s instead of [[monolithic design]].

Different services can be used in conjunction as a [[Service Mesh]] to provide the functionality of a large application ([[modular programming]]). 

SOA integrates distributes, separately maintained and deployed software components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that facilitate components' communication and cooperation over a network, especially over an IP network.

SOA is related to the [[API]] idea, an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software.

## Principles

There are no industry standards relating to the exact composition of a service-oriented architecture, although many industry sources have published their own principles. 

![[Service Contract]]

![[Service Reference Autonomy]]

![[Service Location Transparency]]

![[Service Longetivity]]

![[Service Abstraction]]

![[Service Autonomy]]

![[Service Statelessness]]

![[Service Granularity]]

![[Service Normalization]]

![[Service Composability]]

![[Service Discovery]]

![[Service Reusability]]

![[Service Encapsulation]]

---

## Patterns

Each SOA building block can play any of the three roles:

![[Service Provider]]

![[Service Broker]]

![[Service Consumer]]
