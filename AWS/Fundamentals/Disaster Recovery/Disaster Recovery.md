# Disaster Recovery

- Any event that has a negative impact on a company's business continuity or finances is a disaster
- Disaster recovery (DR) is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster
- What kind of disaster recovery?
    - On-premise => On-premise: traditional DR, and very expensive
    - On-premise => AWS Cloud: [[hybrid recovery]]
    - AWS Cloud Region A => AWS Cloud Region B
- Need to define two terms:
    - RPO : [[Recovery Point Objective]]
    - RTO : [[Recovery Time Objective]]
