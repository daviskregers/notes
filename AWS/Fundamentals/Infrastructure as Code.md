## Infrastructure as Code

- Current we have been doing a lot of [[manual work]]
- All this manual work will be very tough to reproduce
    - In a another region
    - In another [[AWS account]]
    - Within the same region if everything was deleted
- Wouldn't it be great if all our infrastructure was code?
- That code would be deployed and create/update/delete our infrastructure
