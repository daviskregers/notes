# AWS Regions and AZs

- AWS has [[AWS Region]] all around the world (us-east-1, eu-west-1)
- Each region has [[Availability Zone]] (us-east-1a,us-east-1b...)
- Each availability zone is a physical data center in the region, but separate from the other ones (so that they're isolated from disasters)
- AWS consoles are region scoped (except for [[IAM]] and [[S3]])

All the regions can be viewed at https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/
