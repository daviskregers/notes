- [[Design Principles]]
    - Perform operations as code ([[infrastructure as code]])
    - [[Annotate documentation]] - Automate the creation of annotated documentation after every build

    - Refine operations procedures frequently - and ensure that team members are familiar with it
    - Anticipate [[failure]]
    - Learn from all [[operational failure]]s
