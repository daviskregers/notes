- Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore.
- They just [[deploy]] the code, functions
- Initially serverless = [[FaaS (Function as a Service)]]
- Serverless was pioneered by [[AWS Lambda]] but now also includes anything that's managed "[[Database]], [[Messaging]], [[Storage]], etc".
- Serverless does not mean that there are no servers, it means you just don't manage / [[provision]] / see them.
