### Server side encryption at rest

- Data is [[encrypted]] after being received by the server
- Data is [[decrypted]] before being sent
- It is stored into an encrypted form thanks to a key (usually a [[data key]])
- The encryption / decryption keys must be managed somewhere and the server must have access to it.
