## DynamoDB for Solutions Architect

- **Operations**: no operations needed, [[auto scaling]] capability, [[Serverless]]
- **Security**: full security though [[IAM Policy]], [[AWS KMS (Key Management Service)]] encryption, [[SSL]] in flight
- **Reliability**: [[Multi AZ]], [[Backups]]
- **Performance**: Single digit millisecond performance, [[DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)]] for caching reads, performance doesn't degrade if your application scales
- **Cost**: Pay per provisioned capacity and storage usage (no need to guess in advance any capacity - can use [[auto scaling]])
