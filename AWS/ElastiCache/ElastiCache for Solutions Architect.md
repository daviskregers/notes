## ElastiCache for Solutions Architect

- **Operations**: same as [[RDS for Solutions Architect]]
- **Security**: AWS responsible for [[OS security]], we are responsible for setting up [[AWS KMS (Key Management Service)]], [[Security Group]]s, [[IAM Policy]], users ([[Redis Auth]]), using [[SSL]]
- **Reliability**: [[Clustering]], [[Multi AZ]]
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond performance, in memory, [[read replica]]s for [[sharding]], very popular [[cache]] option
- **Cost**: Pay per hour based on [[AWS EC2]] and storage use
