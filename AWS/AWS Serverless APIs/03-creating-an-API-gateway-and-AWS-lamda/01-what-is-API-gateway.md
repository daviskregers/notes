# What is API Gateway

## How it works

With `API Gateway`, we can build `RESTful APIs`. These can be for Web applications, mobile apps or other sources.

You can define API endpoints and HTTP methods that trigger some action that directly accesses some AWS services like lamda that runs code on demand.
