# AWS Cognito

- We want to give our users an identity so that they can interact with our application
- Cognito User Pools
    - Sign in functionality for app users
    - Integrate with API Gateway
    - Create a serverless database of users for your mobile apps
    - Simple login: username (or email) and password combination
    - Can enable Federated Identities (facebook, Google, SAML)
    - Sends back JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
    - Can be integrated with API Gateway for authentication
- Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identity)
    - Provide AWS credentials to users so they can access AWS resources directly
    - Integrate with Cognito User Pools as an identity provider
    - Goal
        - Provide direct access to AWS Resources from the Client Side
    - How
        - Log in to federated identity provider - or remain anonymous
        - Get temporary AWS credentials back from the Federated Identity Pool
        - These credentials come with a pre-defined IAM policy stating their permissions
    - Example
        - provide (temporary) access to write to S3 bucket using Facebook Login
- Cognito Sync
    - Deprecated - use AWS AppSync now
    - Store preferences, configuration, state of app
    - Cross device synchronization (any platform - iOS, Android, etc)
    - Offline capability (synchronization when back online)
    - Requires Federated Identity Pool in Cognito (not User Pool)
    - Store data in datasets (up to 1MB)
    - Up to 20 datasets to synchronise
