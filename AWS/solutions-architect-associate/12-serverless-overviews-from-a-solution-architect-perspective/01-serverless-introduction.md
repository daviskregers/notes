# What's serverless?

- Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore.
- They just deploy the code, functions
- Initially serverless = FaaS (Function as a Service)
- Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lamda but now also includes anything that's managed "databases, messaging, storage, etc".
- Serverless does not mean that there are no servers, it means you just don't manage / provision / see them.
