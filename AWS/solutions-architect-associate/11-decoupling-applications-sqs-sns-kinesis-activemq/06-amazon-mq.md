# Amazon MQ

- SQS, SNS are "cloud-native" services, and they're using proprietary protocols from AWS.
- Traditional applications running from on-premise may use open protocols such as MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
- When migrating to cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
- Amazon MQ = managed Apache ActiveMQ
- Amazon MQ doesn't scale as much as SQS / SNS
- Amazon MQ runs on a dedicated machine, can run in High Availability failover
- Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)
