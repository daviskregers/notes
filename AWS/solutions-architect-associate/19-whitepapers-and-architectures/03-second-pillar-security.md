# Second Pillar - Security

- Includes the ability to protect information, systems and assets while delivering business value though risk assesments and mitigation strategies
- Design principles
    - **Implement a string identity foundation** - centralize privilege management and reduce (or even eliminate) reliance on long-term credentials - principe of least privilege IAM
    - **Enable traceability** - Integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action
    - **Apply security at all layers** - Like edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer, every instance, operating system and application
    - **Automate security best practices**
    - **Protect data in transit and at rest** - encryption, tokenization and access control
    - **Keep people away from data** - Reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data
    - **Prepare for security events** - run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation and recovery
