# Egress Only Internet Gateway

- Egress only Internet Gateway if for IPv6 only
- Similar function as a NAT, but a NAT is for IPv4
- Good to know: IPV6 are all public addresses
- Therefore all our instances with IPv6 are publicly accessable
- Egress only Internet Gateway gives our IPv6 instances access to the internet, but they won't be directly reachable by the internet
- After creating an Egrees Only Internet Gateway, edit the route tables
