# Mobile Application: MyTodoList

- We want to create a mobile application with the following requirements
    - Expose as REST API with HTTPS
    - Serverless architecture
    - Users should be able to directly interact with their own folder in S3
    - Users should authenticate through a managed serverless service
    - The users can write and read to-dos, but they mostly read them
    - The database should scale, and have some high read throughput
