## AWS KMS 101

- Anytime you need to *share sensitive information* - use [[AWS KMS (Key Management Service)]]
    - Database passwords
    - Credentials to external service
    - Private key of [[SSL certificate]]s
- The value in [[AWS KMS (Key Management Service)]] is that the [[CMK]] used to [[encrypt]] data can never be retrieved by the user, and the [[CMK]] can be rotated for extra security
- Never ever store your secrets in [[plaintext]], especially in your code!
- Encrypted [[secrets]] can be stored in the code / [[environment variables]]
- KMS can only help in encrypting up to 4KB of data per call
- IF data > 4 KB, use [[envelope encryption]]
- To give access to [[AWS KMS (Key Management Service)]] to someone:
    - Make sure [[Key Policy]] allows the user
    - Make sure [[IAM policy]] allows the API Calls
