# [[AWS CLI]] Setup on [[MacOS]]

The [[MacOS]] version of [[AWS CLI]] can be downloaded from [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html) and will list all of the steps to install it.

Once it's installed we can open terminal and check `aws --version`.
