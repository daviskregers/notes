## Route53 as a Registrar

A [[domain name registrar]] is an organisation that manages the reservation of internet domain names like GoDaddy, Google Domains and also [[AWS Route 53]].

But, if you buy a domain from a 3rd party, you can still use [[AWS Route 53]].

- Create A [[Hosted Zone]] in [[AWS Route 53]].
- Update [[NS Record]]s on 3rd party to use Route 53 [[name server]]s.
