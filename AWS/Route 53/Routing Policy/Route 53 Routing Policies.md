# [[AWS Route 53]] - Routing Policies

- Define how [[AWS Route 53]] responds to [[DNS queries]]
- Don't get confused by the word "Routing"
    - It's not the same as [[Load Balancer]] routing which routes the traffic
    - [[DNS]] does not route any traffic, it only responds to [[DNS queries]]
- Route 53 supports the following routing policies
    - [[Simple Routing Policy]]
    - [[Weighted Routing Policy]]
    - [[Failover Routing Policy]]
    - [[Latency based Routing Policy]]
    - [[Geolocation Routing Policy]]
    - [[Multi-Value Routing Policy]]
    - [[Geolocation Routing Policy]] (using [[Route 53 Traffic Flow]] feature)
