# Distributing Paid Content

- We sell videos online and users have to pay to buy videos
- Each video can be bough by many customers
- We only want to distribute videos to users who are premium users
- We have a database of premium users
- Links we send to premium users should be short lived
- Our application is global
- We want to be fully [[Serverless]]
