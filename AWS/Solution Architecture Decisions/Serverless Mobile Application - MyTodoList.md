# Serverless Mobile Application: MyTodoList

- We want to create a mobile application with the following requirements
    - Expose as [[REST API]] with [[HTTPS]]
    - [[Serverless architecture]]
    - Users should be able to directly interact with their own folder in [[AWS S3]]
    - Users should authenticate through a managed [[serverless]] service
    - The users can write and read to-dos, but they mostly read them
    - The database should scale, and have some high read throughput
