# Hybrid Cloud for Storage

- AWS is pushing for "[[hybrid cloud]]"
    - Part of your [[infrastructure]] is on the [[cloud]]
    - Part of your [[infrastructure]] is [[on-premise]]
- This can be due to
    - Long cloud [[migration]]s
    - [[Security requirements]]
    - [[Compliance requirements]]
    - [[IT strategy]]
- [[AWS S3]] is a proprietary storage technology (unlike [[EFS - Elastic File System]] / [[NFS]]), so how do you expose the [[AWS S3]] data on premise? [[AWS Storage Gateway]].
