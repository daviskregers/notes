## EBS Volume Types

EBS Volumes come in 4 Types:

![[GP2 (SSD)]]

![[IOI (SSD)]]

![[STI (HDD)]]

![[SCI (HDD)]]

- EBS Volumes are characterised in Size | [[Throughput]] | [[IOPS]] (I/O Ops per sec)
- When in doubt always consult with the AWS documentations.
- Only [[GP2 (SSD)]] and [[IOI (SSD)]] can be used as boot volumes.
