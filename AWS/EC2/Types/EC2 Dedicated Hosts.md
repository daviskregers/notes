## Dedicated Hosts 

- Physical dedicated [[AWS EC2]] server for your use
- Full control of [[AWS EC2]] instance placement
- Visibility into the underlying [[sockets]] / [[physical cores]] of the [[hardware]]
- Allocated for you account for a 3 year period reservation
- More expensive
- Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL - [[Bring Your Own License]])
- Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs
