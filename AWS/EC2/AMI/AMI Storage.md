## AMI Storage

- Your [[EC2 AMIs]] take space and they live in [[AWS S3]]
- [[AWS S3]] is a durable, cheap and resilient storage where most of your backups will live (but you won't see them in the [[AWS S3]] console)
- By default your [[EC2 AMIs]] are private and locked for your [[AWS Account]] / [[AWS Region]]
- You can also make your AMIs public and share them with other AWS accounts or sell them on the [[AMI Marketplace]]
