# Exam tips

## Practice makes perfect

- If you're new to AWS, take a bit of AWS practice thanks to this course before rushing to the exam
- The exam recommends you to have one or more years of hands-on experience on AWS
- Practice makes perfect!
- If you feel overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge you just learned, just go though it one more time

## Proceed by elimination

- Most questions are going to be scenario based
- For all the questions, rule out answers that you know for sure are wrong
- For the remaining answers, understand which one makes the most sense
- There are very few trick questions
- Don't over think it
- If a solution seems feasible but highly complicated, it's probably wrong

## Skim the AWS Whitepapers
