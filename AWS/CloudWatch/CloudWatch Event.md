# CloudWatch Events

- Schedule: [[Cron Jobs]]
- [[Event Pattern]]: Event rules to react to if a service is doing something
    - Ex: [[CodePipeline]] state changes
- Triggers to [[AWS Lambda]] functions, [[AWS SQS]]/[[AWS SNS]]/[[Kinesis]] Messages
- [[CloudWatch]] Event creates a small [[JSON]] document to give information about the change
