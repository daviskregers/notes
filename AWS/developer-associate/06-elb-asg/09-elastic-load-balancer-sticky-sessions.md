# Elastic Load Balancer - Sticky Sessions

- It is possible to implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
- This works for Classic Load Balancers & Application Load Balancers
- The "cookie" used for stickiness has an expiration date you control
- Use case: make sure the user doesn't lose his session data
- Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances

## Cookie Names

- Application-based cookies
    - Custom cookie
        - Generated by the target
        - Can include any custom attributes required by the application
        - Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
        - Don't use AWSALB, AWSALBAPP or AWSALBTG (reserved for use by the ELB)
    - Application cookie
        - Generated by the load balancer
        - Cookie name is AWSALBAPP
- Duration-based cookies
    - Cookie generated by the load balancer
    - Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB
