# Serverless introduction

- Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore
- They just deploy code
- They just deploy... functions!
- Initially Serverless == FaaS (Function as a Service)
- Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but not also includes anything that's managed: databases, messaging, storage etc
- Serverless does not mean there are no servers - it means you just don't manage / provision / see them.
