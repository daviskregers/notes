- Handle [[API versioning]] (v1, v2)
- Handle different environments (dev, test, prod)
- Handle security ([[Authentication and Authorization]])
- Create [[API keys]], handle [[request throttling]]
- [[Swagger]] / [[Open API]] import to quickly define APIs
- Transform and validate requests and responses
- Generate [[SDK and API specifications]]
- [[Cache API]] responses
