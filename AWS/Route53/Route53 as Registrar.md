## Route53 as a Registrar

A domain name registrar is an organization that manages the reservation of internet domain names like GoDaddy, Google Domains and also Route 53.

But, if you buy a domain from a 3rd party, you can still use Route 53.

- Create A Hosted Zone in Route 53.
- Update NS Records on 3rd party to use Route 53 name servers.
