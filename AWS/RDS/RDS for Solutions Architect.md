# RDS for Solutions Architect

- Read replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements (not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Amazon RDS supports [[Transparent Data Encryption]] for DB encryption:
    - Oracle or SQL Server DB instance only
    - TDE can be used on top of KMS - may affect performance
- [[IAM Authentication]] (versus traditional username / password):
    - Works for [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]]
    - Lifespan of an authentication token is 15 minutes (short-lived)
    - Tokens are generated by AWS credentials
    - [[SSL]] must be used when connecting to the database
    - Easy to use [[EC2 Instance Roles]] to connect to the RDS database


- **Operations**: small [[downtime]] when [[failover]] happens, when maintenance happens, scaling in [[Read Replica]]s / [[AWS EC2]] instance / restore EBS implies manual intervention, application changes
- **Security**: AWS responsible for [[OS security]], we are responsible for setting up [[AWS KMS (Key Management Service)]], [[Security Group]]s, [[IAM Policy]], authorizing users in DB, using [[SSL]]
- **Reliability**: [[Multi AZ]] feature, [[failover]] in case of failures
- **Performance**: depends on [[EC2 instance type]], [[EBS Volume]], ability to add [[Read Replica]]s. Doesn't auto-scale
- **Cost**: Pay per hour based on provisioned [[AWS EC2]] and [[EBS Volume]]
