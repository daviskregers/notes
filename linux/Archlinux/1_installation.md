# Arch linux installation

Download .iso from [https://www.archlinux.org/download](Arch linux downloads)
Then write the iso to a bootable flash, where X is the flash device identifier. (can be found using `lsblk` command).

```bash
dd if=/path/to/image.iso of=/dev/sdX
```

Reboot computer and boot into the arch stick.


Check for efivars and internet connection.

```bash
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
ping archlinux.org
```

If the efivars returns a list of files instead of an error, you will need to make an EFI partition in later steps.


## Format drives

```bash

fdisk -l
fdisk /dev/sdX

```

Where X is the drive you want to install the arch to. This will open an interface where you can manage drive partitions, to delete them all - enter 
the command `d` a few times.

### Create EFI partition (skip if no efivars found)

1. Press n
2. Select p (primary)
3. Press enter (1)
4. Press enter (start at the very start)
5. Write `+550M` - this will create a 550M partition

### Create boot partition (skip if efivars found)

1. Press n
2. Select p (primary)
3. Press enter (2)
4. Press enter (start at the very start)
5. Write `+200M` - this will create a 200M partition

### Create SWAP partition

1. Press n
2. Select p
3. Enter
4. Enter
5. +24G -- 150% of RAM

### Create / root partition

```
Later on switched to using root `/` and home `/home` in the same partition because 
sometimes by root directory would run out of space because of docker images, which sometimes becomes annoying to deal with.

Could have increased the root partition, but aside from that, I don't really need that much.
```

1. Press n
2. Select p
3. Enter
4. Enter
5. +50G

### Create /home partition 

1. Press n
2. Select p
3. Enter
4. Enter
5. Enter (takes up the rest of the drive)

### Apply changes

There are no changes made to the drive yet. To apply them press `w`. Note that it will wipe your hd clean and all the data on it will be lost.


### Make file systems

```bash

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 or mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1 # (no efivars vs efivars)
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4
mkswap /dev/sda3

```

## Mount drives

```bash
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/boot /mnt/home /mnt/efi
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/efi
mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/home
```

## Install Arch

```bash
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel
```

## Write the mounts to `fstab`

```bash
genfstab /mnt -U >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

## Change root to freshly installed arch

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
```

## Apply time settings & locales

```bash

ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Riga /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc

nano /etc/locale.gen # uncomment wanted locales
locale-gen

nano /etc/locale.conf # put LANG=en_US.UTF-8
nano /etc/hostname # put your machine hostname like `davis-arch`
```

## Set up hosts

```bash
nano /etc/hosts
```

```
127.0.0.1	localhost
::1		localhost
127.0.1.1	davis-arch.localdomain davis-arch
```

## Change root password

```bash
passwd
```

## Install grub

```bash
pacman -S grub os-prober
grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Install network manager

```bash
pacman -S networkmanager
systemctl enable NetworkManager
```

## Exit setup

Press `CTRL+d` or `exit` and type `reboot`.
