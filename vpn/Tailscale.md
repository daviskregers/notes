# Tailscale

Tailscale is a tool which you can use for having a VPN solution, that also acts for sharing different resources like databases etc across different [[infrastructure]].

You basically define a network and then add machines to it. 

While it's cool, you are essentially adding software that gives access to a 3rd party company to your stuff. An alternative for that would be to use an open-source software like [[Headscale]].
