You can use this tool to connect to Xiaomi thermometers via [[bluetooth]] and record their values.

To get the thermometer [[mac address]]es, add them to the home app, under the sensor -> about you will see the address.

This will support sending the measurements to [[MQTT]] as well as other options.
