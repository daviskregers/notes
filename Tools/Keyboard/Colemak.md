The [[QWERTY]] layout was designed in the 19th century. **Colemak** is a modern alternative to the [[QWERTY]] and [[Dvorak]] layouts, designed for efficient and ergonomic touch typing in English.  
Learning Colemak is a one-time investment that will allow you to enjoy faster and pain-free typing for the rest of your life. Colemak is now the 3rd most popular [[keyboard layout]] for touch typing in English, after QWERTY and Dvorak and comes pre-installed on [Mac](https://colemak.com/Mac "Mac") and [Linux](https://colemak.com/Unix "Unix") systems.
