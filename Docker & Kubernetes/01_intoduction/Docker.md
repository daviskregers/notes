Docker is a platform or ecosystem around creating and running [[Docker container]]s. Containers are instances of pre-build [[Docker Image]] - a single file that has all the [[dependencies]] and [[configuration]] to run certain [[software]].

# Why use Docker?

Docker makes it really easy to install and run [[software]] without worrying about setup or [[dependencies]].
