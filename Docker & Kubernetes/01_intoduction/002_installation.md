# Windows

If you are a Windows Home user, you will not be able install the Docker for Windows Desktop edition, as it requires Hyper-V virtualization. This is supported only by Windows Professional and Enterprise editions.

Windows Home users will need to install Docker Toolbox which uses VirtualBox instead. Please follow the instructions below for installation:

https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/

You may also need to enable virtualization in your computer's BIOS settings. This will be different for each manufacturer, please refer to their documentation on which keys to use to access these settings on reboot.

*Note*

A major difference between the course lecture using Docker Desktop vs. Docker Toolbox is that you will not be able to use localhost anymore.

Instead, you will need to access your machine with the IP address 192.168.99.100
