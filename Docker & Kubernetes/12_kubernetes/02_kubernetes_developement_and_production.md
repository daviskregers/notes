# Kubernetes development and production

When using kubernetes, there is a very large distinction when using it on development environment and on production environment.
In a development environment, we make use kubernetes  by using an application like `minikube`. 
In production environment, we most likely will use managed solutions like:

- `Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)`
- `Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine (GKE)`
- Other self-hosted solutions
