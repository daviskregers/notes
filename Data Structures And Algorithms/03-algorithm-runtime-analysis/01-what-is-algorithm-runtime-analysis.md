# What is algorithm runtime analysis

Algorithm runtime analysis is a study of a given algorithm's running time, by identifying it's behaviour as the input size for the algorithm increases. In laymans terms - it measures algorithm's performance.

Runtime analysis is used to measure efficiency of any given algorithm.
