# Linked list vs array

The main difference between a linked list and array is that each element of the linked list is a separate object where the elements in array are not seperate objects - the array is the object.

For example, when we need to delete an element from the linked list, that can be done, but we can't really delete an element from an array.

Also, the linked list can be variable size.

Random access. If we need the 3rd element of the array, we just access it. But in order to access it in a linked list, we have to traverse.
