# When to use and avoid recursion

When to use recursion:
- When we can easily break down a problem into similar subproblems.
- When we are ok with extra overhead (both time and space) that comes with it.
- When we need a quick working solution instead of an efficient one.

When to avoid recursion:
- If the response to any of the above statements are NO, we should not go with recursion.
