# What is greedy algorithm

- Greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece. 
- It always chooses the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.
- Greedy fits perfectly for those solutions in which choosing a locally optimal solution also leads to global optimal solution (aka `greedy choice`).

## Common greedy algorithms

- Already taught algoritms:
    - Insertion Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Topological Sort
    - Prims
    - Kruskal
- Activity Selection Problem
- Coin Change Problem
- Fractional Knapsack
