# Introduction

Go was created by a small team in Google, which consisted of
- Rober Griesemar
- Rob Pike
- Ken Thompson

Why a new language?

```
Python    - Easy to use, but slow
Java      - Increasingly complex type system
C/C++     - Complex type system, slow compile times
```

---

Golang has
- strong and statically typed language
- excellent community
- key features
    - simplicity
    - fast compile times
    - garbage collected
    - built-in concurrency
    - compile to standalone binaries
