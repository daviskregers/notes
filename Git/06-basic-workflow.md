## Basic Git Workflow

The basic Git workflow will look like this:

```
git add filename
git commit -m "The description of the commit"
git pull origin master
git push origin master
```

So, we add a filename to the staging area, commit it, pull the latest changes from the `origin`'s master branch, and push our commit to the `origin`'s master branch.
