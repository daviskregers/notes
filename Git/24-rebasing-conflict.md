 bigtrouble  git rebase master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: fb adding trouble to file
Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
M	file
Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
Auto-merging file
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file
error: Failed to merge in the changes.
Patch failed at 0001 fb adding trouble to file
hint: Use 'git am --show-current-patch' to see the failed patch

Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
"git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
```

We can abort the rebase and no changes will be made.

```
davis@davis-arch  ~/projects/learning-git/project  ➦ 0861e5d ●✚ >R>  git rebase --abort
```

Or we can resolve the conflict by using the mergetool:

```
git mergetool
```

Select the changes and save.

```

Do some additional changes:

```
 bigtrouble  echo "Yet another change" >> file
  bigtrouble ●  git commit -am "change after rebase"
[bigtrouble ddef7ba] change after rebase
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  bigtrouble  git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
  master  git merge bigtrouble 
Updating 0861e5d..ddef7ba
Fast-forward
 file | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
  master  git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	file.orig

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

And again, the merge resulted in fast forward merge, no conflict found.
