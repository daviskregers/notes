# Matching Fit

Take your top 3 sheet you made previously and see if something catches your eye
regarding something you're evaluating.

Look at your idea and see if matches your hobbies, skills, experience, passions.
Experience and skills matter more than passion.

Ask yourself:
- Could I do this every single day without losing interest?
- If this idea failed, will I still gain valuable lessons and learn valuable skills?
- Do I have a step-by-step plan for my idea?
- Do you have the resources to do it?

A business opportunity you can't pursue is not an opportunity.

- Does your idea have a window?

Reflect if you can actually get in within this time window.

- Break your idea into pieces and analyze them
- What pieces do you have the ability to work on?
- You can also pick one piece and build a business around that

Example:
- Managing airbnb properties
    - Breaking down:
        - Optimize people listing descriptions
        - Manage cleanings
        - Manage checkins
        - Relay communication from customer to owner
        - Setting up a system to respond to inquiries
    - You can pick one and start a business on only one if it's too much
