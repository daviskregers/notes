# Path to validation

Validation is to get your business to a point that you can validate that there actually is a demand for your product.

Required to validate your idea:
- Difficulty to validate:
    - Protein bars (easy to validate)
        - You can use a landing page for validation
        - If you get people to buy the bar, you validated it
    - New credit card technology (hard to validate)
        - Prove the customers that will use the product
        - Merchants will agree to use it
        - Payment processors will use it
        - You need to validate the core assumptions:
            - People are having problems with their credit cards
            - All 3 parties have problems
            - People care about security about their credit cards
            - People are open to try new technology
