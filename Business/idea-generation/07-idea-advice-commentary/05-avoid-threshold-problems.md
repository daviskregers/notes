# Avoid threshold ideas

There are ideas that require certain amount of customers before you start getting customers - that is a threshold idea. You need a lot of experience and a lot of time to pull it off.

- social network platforms
- market place platforms

- How bad is your threshold problem?

Strategies for solving a problem:
- Seeding the one side
- Faking it
- Lower transparency so one side doesn't see how many people are on the other side
