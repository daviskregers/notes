# The value of ideas

Your idea has no value by itself.

- Hiding ideas
    - Ideas do not get better by sitting in your head
    - It's better to test a bad idea than hide a good one
- NDAs
    - They don't really work
    - They're hard to write and hard to enforce
- Patents
    - Patents are usually a waste of time
    - It takes 2.5 years to make it
    - You can never be 100% protected

Focus on execution.

"Business ideas are like buses. If you miss one, there's one coming in 10 minutes" - Richard Branson
