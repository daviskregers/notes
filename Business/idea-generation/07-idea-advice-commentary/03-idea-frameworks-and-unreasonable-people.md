# Idea frameworks & unreasonable people

There is no framework for ideas. The process of idea generation is fluid and you can't really measure it.

You have to actively try to look for ideas.

If there was a framework, every single idea would be done.

Ideas often come from unreasonable people, they think more outside of the bounds of the system already established.

Work towards finding ideas. Try to be unreasonable.
