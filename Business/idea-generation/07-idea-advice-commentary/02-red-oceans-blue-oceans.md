# Red oceans, blue oceans

Red ocean - any market that has a lot of players in it. Well known profits.
Blue ocean - no signs of actually being a market. More speculative, explorative.

Depending on the business type you want to build, this makes a difference:
- Lifestyle business
    - You should go for a red ocean
    - You probably want to be in 75% percentile of a trend adoption curve
- Startups
    - You should go for a blue ocean
- Side business
    - Red ocean
