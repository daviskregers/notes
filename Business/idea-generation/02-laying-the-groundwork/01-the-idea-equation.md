# The idea equation

Every business idea out there consists of different components. when an idea
doesn't have all of these components, it is not a complete business idea.

## Example of a complete idea:

- Vacation rental owners have trouble buying rental supplies like linens & towels. This problem would be solved with a subscription service business that automatically replenishes these supplies.

## Example of incomplete idea:

- Vacation rental owners rely too much on one or two platforms for bookings.

## Components

A complete business idea consists of 3 components:

- The subject
    - who in your idea is benefitting from the product / service?
    - Group of people I'm targeting with this idea.
    - Don't just use all people, pick a specific group.
- The problem / benefit
    - Identify what the subject is having a problem with.
    - How the group will benefit
    - Problem example: Employees in midsize companies want to communicate with rich media, like images. Currently they cannot, and they have to use x,y,z workaround in order to do it.
    - Benefit example: By supplying all employees in mid-size companies with bluetooth headsets, they could communicate at 3x their normal rate.
- Business model
    - Have more business models for backup


```
Complete business idea = Subject + Problem/Benefit + Business model
```
