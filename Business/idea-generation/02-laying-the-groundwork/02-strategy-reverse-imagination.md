# Reverse imagination

When looking at the past there are multiple things that when looked at now - they seem stupid.
Imagine the future and think what is stupid today.

Example: PayPal was created because they thought it was stupid that we couldn't
transfer money online.

Look around your room and think what item is there that will be unnecessary in future.

Try to predict trends and think of businesses that will facilitate it and benefit
from it.
