# Cater to power users

Power users - people that use a service or platform way more than average people.
Platform - any online service or community or tool that brings together large groups of people.

Examples: ebay and amazon.

## How it works

Identify a group of power users in a platform and find out what problems are they having.

- Platforms can't grow if they only focus on the top power users.
- They need very specific things which will have no value on the rest of the user base.
- It's better to have a deep and narrow well than a wide and shallow well.

## What to look for

- Find a platform, play around in it and find a user that uses the platform a lot
- Ask them what problems are they facing, what frustrates them on a daily basis
- Try to pick a new platform, established platforms will have less oppurtunities
