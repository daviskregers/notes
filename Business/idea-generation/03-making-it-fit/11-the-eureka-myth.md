# The Eureka Myth

The "eureka" moment idea states that all brilliant people have their brilliant ideas
and they just happen, hence the saying eureka. Like apple on Newtons head.

It's complete bullshit.

People wait for the perfect idea. Mist brilliant ideas started as something else.

All the startup ideas started differently and over time they changed presented
more knowledge on the matter. It gets better and better until you can't even
recognize the original idea.

Examples:
- Facebook started as an application for 1 college to compare attractiveness between classmates.
- Airbnb started just as system to find a floor to sleep in while in a conference and all the hotels are booked up. To meet overflow.
- Groupon started as a platform for people to donate to charities, which has no relation to what it is now.
- Pinterest started as an app for going to designers websites and marking things you were interested in, it would notify you when those things go on sale.
- Twitter started as a podcast subscription service
- Flickr started as a video game called never ending game
- Instagram started as a check-in app
- Nintendo started off selling vacuum cleaners

Follow the lean startup concepts.

"When we're in the shower, when we're thinking about our idea, boy, does it sound brilliant. But the reality is that most of our ideas are actually terrible." - Eric Ries

Every idea does with key assumptions, but you'll won't know for sure until you actually test them. You will be surprised on how wrong you are.

Brilliant people also make dumb decisions. The only difference between you and brilliant people is that they try them, understand what they did wrong sooner, pivot and evolve these ideas and eventually get them right.
