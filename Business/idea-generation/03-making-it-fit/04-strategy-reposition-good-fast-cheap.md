# Reposition Good / Fast / Cheap

This one is one of the easiest way to come up with business ideas.

Every business out there can be rated on 3 different dimensions:
- Good
- Fast
- Cheap

You can be only 2/3

- Think of an industry you are interested in
    - What's the last website that you used?
    - Are they on to something?
- Think of a way to do what they're doing but a little bit better.

Example:

- You're really interested in app development and contracting
- You find gigster app that matches contractors with companies
- Try to figure out what dimensions are they working on.
- Fast, Good
- Which of the other combinations could you capitalize on a different part of the market or the market that gigster is already serving?
