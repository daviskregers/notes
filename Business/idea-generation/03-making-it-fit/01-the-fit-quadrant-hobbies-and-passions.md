# The Fit Quadrant: Hobbies and Passions

Hobbies and passions are probably the biggest source of business ideas.

## Hobbies

Hobby is something you do for fun at your own will. You have a natural inclination towards something.
Starting a business is hard and it is even harder if you don't really enjoy what you're doing.

- What do you naturally find yourself doing?
- Hobbies are what you enjoy doing
- Analyze what you're doing

To see if your hobby qualifies for turning it into a business, ask yourself:
- Could you do that all day?
- Could you manage doing supportive tasks around it but not actually doing it? E.g. Building an app for running - figuring out how it looks like etc.

## Passions

Things that you spend a lot of time thinking about and really care about. You
generally want to spend a large amount of time working on or working towards.

Write down 5 things you care about. Skip the generic ones like friends and family.
