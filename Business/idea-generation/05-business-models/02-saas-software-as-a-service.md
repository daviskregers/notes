# SaaS: Software as a Service

Any business delivers value, you sell software as a service instead of a product. Browser version of desktop apps, charges online.

- Because it is in a browser:
    - You can reach a lot more people
    - You can grow your business a lot more easily
    - Frees up a lot of resources you can use for marketing etc

Examples:
- Xero
- Spotify

What to look for:
- Offline to online: things that are often done on paper but can be done online
- Services that are used frequently
- Collecting user information - convenient to store user information (evenote)
- Avoid copying and being pirated (photoshop)
