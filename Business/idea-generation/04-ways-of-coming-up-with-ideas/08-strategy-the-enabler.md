# Strategy: The Enabler

We have a large group of people that want to do something but can't because
there is a large technical investment required to get started. The bar to entry is too high.

Look for solutions to make this process easier.

- Look at an alternative industry
- Research what it would take to make your first sale in that industry
- Check regulations
- Check investment required
- Think of how to solve it

- Starting in medicine / healthcare is difficult
- Because of regulations like HIPAA
- One companies trying to solve this is aptible
