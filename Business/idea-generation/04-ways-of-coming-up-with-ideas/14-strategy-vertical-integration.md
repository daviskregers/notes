Very rarely a company that sells computers owns a company that manufactures them, ships and transports them.

- Look for combining 2 segments of value chain in an industry

- When running a card shop, you have to buy them, you have store to sell them.
- If a card shop also writes them and prints them - you can give them personalized cards on the spot, speed and flexibility.
