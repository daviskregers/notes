# Strategy: Trends in outsourcing

Over time more and more things become automated. In virtually all scenarios there are
roughly two steps to follow:
- A brand new task
- Automate it

Essentially every new task starts with a hard task, over time it becomes easier and
can be delegated, then eventually it becomes fully automated.

You can find opportunities and target tasks between outsourcing and partial automated
stages.

Go to upwork, freelancer and scan the job listings. Look for posts that have high
frequency. Sort by high end prices.
