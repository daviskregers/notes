# Strategy: One Step Strategy

People like convenience. There are tasks that require multiple step process.

- Push for pizza. One button, when you press it, it delivers a medium-sized cheese pizza to your GPS location.
- Rev - send a file of a video, within 24 hours you receive subtitles etc.
- Amazon 1-click buy

- Look for industry you're interested in
- Think about the processes to do something
- Think what happens when you remove a step / all the steps

- It doesn't work when personalization is important
