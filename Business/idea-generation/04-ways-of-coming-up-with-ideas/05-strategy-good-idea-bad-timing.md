# Strategy: Good idea, bad timing

There are many companies that tried to do something of value, but did it at the
wrong time.

Youtube wasn't the first site to host video, there was pseudo.com, but it did
not look that good on a 56K modem.

Look for companies that failed and ask yourself:
- Did they fail because their timing wasn't right or was it something else?

Some of the factors that may affect bad timing:
- Cultural acceptance and cultural norms
- Infrastructure
- Legal issues
- Technical issues
