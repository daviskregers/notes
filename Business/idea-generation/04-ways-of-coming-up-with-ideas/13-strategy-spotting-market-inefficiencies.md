# Strategy: Spotting market inefficiencies

These inefficiencies can occur because of various reasons:
- The profit motive. Businesses try to maximize their profits and minimize costs, but that doesn't really align with customer needs. Examples: Private education- maximizing how much students pay buy actually learn doesn't really make sense.
- Goverment regulations - rent control, rent cannot increase only 1-2% per year.
- Not enough potential profit - Orphan drugs and orphan populations.

What to look for:
- Look for completely irrational pricing
    - Private education vs public education price gap
    - Housing prices
    - Drug prices
- Look for weird consumer behaviours
    - People from Brazil comping to US to buy Apple products
    - Landlords actively try to evict their tenants

How to build an idea:
- Look for the problems caused by the inefficiency
    - Work on importing electronics
    - Can't fix the rent problem, but you can make landlords and tenants life easier.
