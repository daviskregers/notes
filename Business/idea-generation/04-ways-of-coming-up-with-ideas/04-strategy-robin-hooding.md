# Strategy: Robin Hooding

Take a solution that usually is offered for a price and offer them for free.

- Think about an industry you're interested in
- Look for a pattern where all the products are offered for a significant fee when the cost for it is quite low

- Do all of the current solutions for this space charge money?
- What percentage of the market is owned by the companies that do charge?
- Is the marginal cost of the product or service low?
