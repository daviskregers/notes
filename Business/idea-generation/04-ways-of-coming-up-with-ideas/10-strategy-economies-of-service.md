# Strategy: Economies of Service

- What service you wish you had but it's way too expensive?
- What services do rich people have that normal people does not?

- tax specialists
- buttlers
- vacation planners
- stylists

- If we didn't change the cost of this service, but instead spread it out amongst more users, could this be a realistic service offered for a lower price?
