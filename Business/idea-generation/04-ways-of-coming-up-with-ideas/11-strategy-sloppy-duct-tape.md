# Strategy: Sloppy Duct Tape

- Think of an examples for workarounds to get something done that are ridiculous

Examples:
- Man duct-tapes ethernet port when he wants to work so he cannot access internet.
- People who during finals swap facebook passwords so they can focus on studies
- Make a stick like device to press a start button on router from desk
- Nail christmas tree to the ceiling so animals cannot reach it

When finding this it is because:
- These people want this problem solved
- There is no solution for it
