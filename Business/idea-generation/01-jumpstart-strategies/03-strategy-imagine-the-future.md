# Imagine the future

```
What great business in the future is not being built today?
```
```
What big problems are being tackled by big companies in the future?
```

- Imagine what future is going to look like? (In 20 or 30 years or so)
    - Do it in a couple of dimensions.
    - How do you think your country will look like?
    - How will be the politics changed?
    - What the future will look like in terms of technology?
- Which of companies for these problems are not being built today?
