# Idea List Builder

Keep a scratchpad where you write down all your ideas, can be unpolished.

Then polish it using following things:

- Describe your idea (1-2 sentences)
- Who is your customer? (who are you selling to?)
- What problem are you solving?
- What business model do you think you would use?
- Do you have experience in this field?
- Are you passionate in this field?
- Do you have any hobbies that related to this field?
- How enthusiastic about this idea are you (rank 1-10)

When finished going through all your ideas, write a summary list of all of
all of them and then rank them.
