# Problem-based business ideas

Virtually every business today exists because it solves a problem.

What are the first 5 companies that come in mind?
What do these companies solve?

- Uber gets you where you want to go faster and cheaper
- Airbnb saves you from being price-gauged by hotels and helps you being from a generic steril experience of sleeping in a motel
- Any video game company solves the problem of being bored

- Dropbox was founded because the founder was tired of bringing files to work and back
- Mint was founded to keep track of personal finances

Take out a sheet of paper and write a list of problems you have day-to-day.
Where there is a problem, there is an opportunity.

Then list next them 2 things - frequency and depth.

Frequency - how often do I have this pain? Rate 1-10
Depth - How big of a deal is this pain? Rate 1-10

One of these must be very high. For example, Uber doesn't solve a huge pain (depth)
but the frequency of how often people need a car is high so that is why they're
such a big company.

Then ask yourself:
- can I solve this problem?
- Is it worth solving?
