# Wouldn't it be great if

## How it works

Just like a thought experiment. Start with a frase `Wouldn't it be great if ___?`
Then it is up to you to answer the question yourself.

Examples:
- Wouldn't it be great if I didn't have to do __ because it would be much easier.
- Wouldn't it be great if the price for __ would be significantly reduced.
- I do __ all the time and I wish it would take half the time.

Make a list of all these items.

Then ask question: Can I make this work?
