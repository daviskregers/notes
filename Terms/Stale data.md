> In computer processing, if a [processor](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/processor) changes the value of an [operand](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/operand) and then, at a subsequent time, fetches the operand and obtains the old rather than the new value of the operand, then it is said to have seen stale data.
